## Overview

This repository demonstrates building and deploying a scalable and secure GenAI-powered ChatBot using FastAPI on Databricks Apps, powered by OpenAI models and Databricks Genie Conversational APIs.

---

## Features

- Ingest CMS provider dataset
- Create Genie Spaces for semantic querying
- Build a search + chat experience using FastAPI
- Deploy and monitor as a scalable Databricks App

---

## Dataset

**CMS DAC_NationalDownloadableFile.csv** includes:

- Facility names and locations
- Provider types, specialties, and services
- Ownership details
- Certification dates

Dataset Reference:[CMS Provider Dataset](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/mj5m-pzi6)
